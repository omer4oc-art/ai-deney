Output ONLY valid Python code. No markdown. No prose. No triple backticks.
Requirements:
- Include docstring + type hints.
- Include input validation (raise ValueError/TypeError).
- If you are unsure about an API, do NOT guess. Prefer the simplest correct approach.
- If you cannot complete the task, output a Python file that raises RuntimeError explaining what is missing.


PROMPT:
Write ok() -> int returning 1.

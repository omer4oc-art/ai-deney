# Dev Run All Demo

Use the guardrail + deterministic full run command:

```bash
cd /Users/omer/ai-deney/week1
source .venv/bin/activate
bash scripts/dev_run_all.sh
```

This runs tests, eval pack, and truth-pack generation in one command.

Expected truth-pack index:
- `outputs/_truth_pack/index.md`
